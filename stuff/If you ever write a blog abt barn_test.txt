Oh gosh, ever since I avoided to write a blog. I thought it is unnecessary in a world full of information all around you. I rather spent my time reading. But, anyway, here we goâ€¦.


Back when I had to perform an employment test for a company I was asked to do some testing on the function that I had to implement. I was somewhat familiar with unit testing in Python and I already spent some time investigating about unit testing frameworks for Cpp, like CppTest and CppUnit. And I came to the point that they sucked. They seemed somewhat bloated, too big for my needs and the usage of macros and the enforcement of a certain setup and registration process, which implies a learning curve for something that should be so easy. They seemed outdated, they smelled, like job security through code obscurity. So, for the task at hand I came up with a neat little function. I spare you the code, because, after all, it was not so clever, i.e. generic and stuff. But it paved the way for a class I called FunctionTest.
